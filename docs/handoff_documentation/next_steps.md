# Next Steps

- Familiarize yourself with the codebase by exploring the key directories: `pages/`, `components/`, and `styles/`.
- Ensure you understand the deployment and login flow, especially how administrative actions are authenticated and performed.
- Update site content such as photos by following the procedure below.

# How to Update Photos on the Site

To update photo content on the deployed website, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the deployed site in your browser.
2. Append `/login` to the URL (e.g., `https://therecyclery.org/login`) to access the admin login page.
3. Enter the admin credentials provided to you by the project leads or team.
4. Once logged in, you will be directed to a secure version of the site interface designed for administrative tasks.
5. From there, you can upload new photos, replace existing ones, or remove outdated content.
6. All changes will reflect on the public-facing site once saved.

> **Note:** Only users with administrative credentials have access to this functionality. If you encounter any issues, contact the project maintainer for support.

# Open Issues (Recommended Future Work)

While we haven’t formally opened GitHub issues, we’ve identified the following areas as potential future improvements:

- Performance tuning and optimization
- Dark mode styling for improved accessibility
- Automated backups for data reliability

We recommend tracking these by creating GitHub issues under a `future-work` label.
